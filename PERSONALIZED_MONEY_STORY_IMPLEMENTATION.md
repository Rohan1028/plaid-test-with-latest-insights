# Personalized Money Origin Story Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
We've successfully transformed the static Money Origin Story into a dynamic, personalized experience that generates unique stories for each user based on their:
- **Mem0 memories** (past insights and patterns)
- **Chat history** (emotional triggers and conversations)
- **Intake responses** (early memories and aspirations)
- **Intervention completions** (growth areas and insights)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Layer
- **Table**: `user_money_stories`
- **Caching**: Stories cached for 1 week
- **Expiration**: Auto-expires and regenerates weekly
- **RLS**: Row-level security for user privacy

### Backend Function
- **Location**: `supabase/functions/generate-money-origin-story/index.ts`
- **AI Integration**: Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1 for story generation
- **Data Aggregation**: Pulls from all user data sources
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation to default milestones

### Frontend Components
- **Hook**: `usePersonalizedStory.tsx` - Manages story state and operations
- **UI**: Enhanced `MoneyTreePage.tsx` with loading states and controls
- **Badge**: `PersonalizationBadge.tsx` - Shows data sources used

## 🔄 User Experience Flow

```
1. User visits Money Tree page
   ↓
2. Hook checks for existing valid story (< 1 week old)
